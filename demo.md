- Answer questions about implementation

## ðŸŽ¯ Demo Script Example

```
"Let me show you how this Search Query Website works. 

First, I'll enter a Wikipedia URL and search for 'date of birth'...

[Enter URL and query]

Notice how the app processes the page and extracts relevant content chunks. 
It automatically removes navigation and ads, keeping only the meaningful content.

[Show results]

Here we can see the top results with relevance scores. The highest match 
shows Sachin Tendulkar was born on April 24, 1973. Each result includes 
a title, path, and match percentage.

[Expand HTML view]

You can also view the actual HTML structure for each result, which is 
useful for developers who want to understand the content structure.

[Try another example]

Let me show you how it works with a different type of website..."
```

## ðŸš€ Next Steps After Demo
